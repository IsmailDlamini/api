// all api endpoints are currently working at the moment
// now i will need to protect the endpoints to ensure that no one will mess with them to gain access
//even though the data that we have is not as importand and will only contain one use 
// it will be important to make sure that i secure the whole thing

// the next thing i would need to do is to implement the rateLimiting middleware to the api to prevent anyoe
//from spamming the sites api and cause any damage that would be fatal to any extent

// the next thing i will need to do is to implement the authorization and 

// after connecting all the endpoints and verifying that they all recieve the data that they need to display the data
// i need to not forget to connect the backend email functionality which should be a simple task to do
//upon finishing that, the app should be hosted without the frontend, so that those with the mobile phones
// can view the site and those that have computers will have to wait 
// then i will start working on the frontend of the computer media query to start with 
// the admin panel will be a thing i shall work with on my spare time on the weekends
// the front end design is almost done what i need to do next is to do the mobile version
// i need to make sure that i finnish this project to get the maximum motivation that i need to finnish
// the rest of the projects that i start making

// i have a paid project coming through soon and i am excited to take it on, it is something i always wanted
// and will push me to do the best at all times in many  ways 

// the next project i should not hesitate to make is the word guessing game which should be fun to make 
// i need to decide on the tech stack i want to use 
// after that i want to go on and make the chat application i wanted to make 
// this should be a project that will teach me more about sockets and more and how they work fun

// finally the projects i need to get into is clones , clones should be good projects for my portfolio 
// in many ways

// and then next year i can push foward to learning about moile app dev 
// that should get me going in terms of the jave industry and it should help me choose which side will choose
